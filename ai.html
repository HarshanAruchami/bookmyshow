      <h2>How to Create a Landing Page</h2>
      <p>Here are a few tips for creating an effective landing page:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with a clear goal.</strong> What do you want visitors to do when they land on your page? Make sure your goal is clear and concise.</li>

        <li><strong>Keep your copy short and sweet.</strong> People don't have time to read long blocks of text, so keep your copy short and to the point.</li>
        <li><strong>Use visuals to break up your text.</strong> Images, videos, and infographics can help to make your landing page more visually appealing and easier to read.</li>
